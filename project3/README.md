Web Scraping and Login
-----------------------
This project is directly tied to project 4 in the sense that the database, routes, and MVC of our 
Ruby on Rails will be used for project 4. This project scrapes the course listing off of OSU's website
and allows users to view the courses with a variety of permissions. This project allows for users of
students, instructors, and admins, in hope to, eventually, use as a program to assign graders to a 
class.

Motivation
-------------
This project is intended to combine our knowledge of Object Oriented Programming in the Ruby langauge
with Rails in order to create a MVC framework. With this project being a foundation for project 4, this
project was also intended for our group to work efficiently such that we would make project 4 easier on
ourselves.

Features
-----------
Our project was implemented using the MVC framework of Ruby on Rails, particularly using ruby v 2.7.1 and rails v 6.0.3.5. 
With the use of gems, we were able to utilize the convenience of Ruby on Rails in the following ways:
1) rails                      -- for the MVC framework
2) sqlite3                    -- for database management
3) puma                       -- for the application server
4) sass-rails                 -- for SCSS stylesheets
5) webpacker                  -- to transpile app-like Javascript
6) turbolinks                 -- to make navigating web application faster
7) jbuilder                   -- to build JSON APIs with ease
8) bootsnap                   -- to reduce boot times through caching
9) mechanize                  -- for issuing HTTP requests
10) nokogiri                  -- to navigate the body of the response
11) devise                    -- to establish an authorication system
12) byebug                    -- to stop execution and get a debugger console
13) web-console               -- to access an interactive console on exception pages
14) listen                    -- to notify changes in the file system
15) spring                    -- to speed up development by keeping application running in background
16) spring-watcher-listener   -- to listen to application running in background
17) capybara                  -- to add support for Capybara system testing
18) selenium-webdriver        -- to add support for selenium driver
19) webdrivers                -- for easy installation and use of web drivers to run system tests with browsers
20) tzinfo-data               -- to include zoneinfo files, since Windows does not

Installation
-------------
After fethcing our project, you first will want to run "bundle install" on your command line.
Next, you must make sure to enter "rails db:migrate" on your command line in order that your schema.rb will be updated.
Finally, you may enter "rails s" on your command line to run our server. 
Now, you may open up your choice of web browser and enter "localhost:3000" in the url field.

Tests
------

1) We made sure that in the CoursesController for both New and Create, that these may only be entered if the user is a verified admin. Otherwise, we redirect to the index page.


2) We made sure that in the ScrapesController for both New and Create, that these may only be entered if the user is a verified admin. Otherwise, we redirect to the index page.

3) For the ApplicationController and Home page, we made sure that if the user is not signed in, then they are not able to view the development links, and only the Sign Up, Login, and Search Courses link

4) For grading, we made sure to add a default, verified admin account with the use of rails seeds.
