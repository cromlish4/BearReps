Web Scraping and Login
-----------------------
This project is directly tied to project 4 in the sense that the database, routes, and MVC of our 
Ruby on Rails will be used for project 4. This project scrapes the course listing off of OSU's website
and allows users to view the courses with a variety of permissions. This project allows for users of
students, instructors, and admins, in hope to, eventually, use as a program to assign graders to a 
class.

Motivation
-------------
This project is intended to combine our knowledge of Object Oriented Programming in the Ruby langauge
with Rails in order to create a MVC framework. With this project being a foundation for project 4, this
project was also intended for our group to work efficiently such that we would make project 4 easier on
ourselves.

Features
-----------
Our project was implemented using the MVC framework of Ruby on Rails, particularly using ruby v 2.7.1 and rails v 6.0.3.5. 
With the use of gems, we were able to utilize the convenience of Ruby on Rails in the following ways:
1) rails                      -- for the MVC framework
2) sqlite3                    -- for database management
3) puma                       -- for the application server
4) sass-rails                 -- for SCSS stylesheets
5) webpacker                  -- to transpile app-like Javascript
6) turbolinks                 -- to make navigating web application faster
7) jbuilder                   -- to build JSON APIs with ease
8) bootsnap                   -- to reduce boot times through caching
9) mechanize                  -- for issuing HTTP requests
10) nokogiri                  -- to navigate the body of the response
11) devise                    -- to establish an authorication system
12) faker                     -- to generate fake data( ie used for 20 accounts to populate db)
13) byebug                    -- to stop execution and get a debugger console
14) web-console               -- to access an interactive console on exception pages
15) listen                    -- to notify changes in the file system
16) spring                    -- to speed up development by keeping application running in background
17) spring-watcher-listener   -- to listen to application running in background
18) capybara                  -- to add support for Capybara system testing
19) selenium-webdriver        -- to add support for selenium driver
20) webdrivers                -- for easy installation and use of web drivers to run system tests with browsers
21) tzinfo-data               -- to include zoneinfo files, since Windows does not

Installation
-------------
After fethcing our project, you first will want to run "bundle install" on your command line.
Next, you must make sure to enter "rails db:migrate" on your command line in order that your schema.rb will be updated.
You will also want to enter "rails db:seed" on your command line in order to get a default, verified admin account in order to see all of our views.
Finally, you may enter "rails s" on your command line to run our server. 
Now, you may open up your choice of web browser and enter "localhost:3000" in the url field.

Running Scraper By Itself
--------------------------
In the case where you might need to run scraper separately you can find it in app/helpers/scraper.rb

To run this from the command line just "cd app/helpers/" then run "ruby scraper.rb"

Enter your search query. Then when it asks for a term decide if you want summer, spring or autumn and select the corresponding number (example, if you want summer type in 1214).
Then follow the same procedure for when it asks you to enter a campus (example, columbus is col).

The program will now scrape through the osu courses and return to you the catalog number, title, term, units and campus.

Tests
------

1) We made sure that in the CoursesController for both New and Create, that these may only be entered if the user is a verified admin. Otherwise, we redirect to the index page.


2) We made sure that in the ScrapesController for both New and Create, that these may only be entered if the user is a verified admin. Otherwise, we redirect to the index page.

3) For the ApplicationController and Home page, we made sure that if the user is not signed in, then they are not able to view the development links, and only the Sign Up, Login, and Search Courses link

4) For grading, we made sure to add a default, verified admin account with the use of rails seeds.


Acknowledgement
---------

Thanks to Michael Cromlish for being the project lead this project. Michael did the initial setup for the Ruby on Rails project.
He also helped in every aspect of the project and scheduled multiple team meetings to make sure the team was staying on good pace.

Andrew Connors implemented the multiple views and their styling in our project, as well as set up / did troubleshooting on our database tables.

Zhuo Chen worked with the web scraper to ensure we were collecting all necessary data from OSU's course listing.

Samiul islam worked with the web scraper to ensure we were collecting all necessary data from OSU's course listing,
as well as debugging / troubleshooting any errors we ran into with the scraper. 

Eric Young implemented the multiple views and their styling in our project, as well as setting up correct routes and controllers for various users.

Ryan O'Donovan implemented the login system with the use of the Devise gem, and implemented three different user permissions based on student, instructor
and admin.
