Ruby Set
--------

"Set" is a card game in which players attempt to find a group of cards that satisfy a particular criterion. 
It is a speed game: 12 cards are dealt face-up, and the players try to be the first to make a set from the visible cards. 
For a complete description of the game see the Wikipedia entry: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game). 
This project creates a functional game of set using ONLY Ruby.

Motivation
----------

This project was intended to combine our knowledge of Objected Oriented Programming, in this case Ruby,
and using version control. While being our group's first experience together, this project was also intended
to build team dynamics and establish a schedule to work with each other. 

Features
--------

Our project was implemented using a few classes. The cards themselves, the deck, the board, and the set parser were
all classes. Thus, we were able to take advantage of OOP's effeciency. While only being text based, both the rules 
and the presentation of the board are accessible to the player from the beginning.

Installation
------------

After fetching our project, you can launch the game by typing "ruby main.rb" on your command line on any PC or VM that has
ruby installed.

Tests
-----

We determined 6 important tests for our code, which all were handled as desired:

1) Incorrect input:
  
    Say a user enters a random string, our project will warn the player about an incorrect entry, and allow for a redo.
    
2) False Set:

    Say a player determined some cards were a set. If he/she was wrong, our game tells the player the set was wrong, and docks a point.
    
3) Correct Set:

    Say a player finally finds a valid set. When the user inputs a true set, our game congratulates the player and awards 1 point. Then
    the board is replenished as desired. 
    
4) No sets left: false

    Say a player believes there are no more sets on the board. If the player missed a set, our game informs the player and gives him/her 
    another chance WITHOUT docking a point.
    
5) No sets left: true

    Say a player believes there are no more sets on the board. If so, the game adds 3 cards to the board, and play continues.
    
6) Exit

    Say at any point, a player wants to end the game. If he/she enters "exit" the program exits everytime.


Acknowledgement
---------------
Huge thanks to Samiul Islam for being the project lead on our first project. Samiul organized team meetings, and helped out in every aspect of the project.

Andrew Connors implemented the DeckMaker class which was fundamental to the progress of project1.

Zhuo Chen implemented the card class which established a framework in order to format our cards and ensured 81 unique cards.

Eric Young implemented our main class which provided rules of Set and tied the work of all our team together.

Michael Cromlish implemented the card parsing class which was used heavily in order to make sure the rules of Set were being implemented correctly.

Ryan O'Donovan implemented the board class which displayed and replenished the game board for the player as needed.
