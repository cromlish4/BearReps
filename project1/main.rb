  puts """Game rules:
  The deck consists of 81 unique cards that vary in 4 features across 3 possibilities for each kind of feature:
  number of shapes (1, 2, 3)
  color (red, green, or purple)
  shading (solid, striped, open)
  shape (diamond, squiggle, oval)
  Each possible combination of features (e.g. a card with 3 striped gree diamonds) appears as a card precisely once in the deck.
  A SET must be either all the same or all different in each individual feature. In other words, if 2 cards are the same and 1 card is different in any feature, then it is NOT a SET (e.g. if 2 are red and 1 is purple then it is NOT a SET).
  In the game, the deck is shuffled and 12 cards are laid face up on the table. When a player finds a SET among these 12 cards, the SET will be removed and the player gets 1 point. Then 3 new cards from the deck will be added to replenish the cards on the table. If there is no SET on the table, 3 cards from the deck will be added one time until there is a SET.\n""" # Game rules
  puts """Input instructions:
  Number of shapes: '1', '2', '3'
  Color: 'R', 'G', 'P' stand for red, gree, purple respectively, Cap's ONLY!
  Shading: ' ', '<', '/' represent open, solid, striped
  Shape: '*', '0', '~' represent diamond, oval, squiggle respectively
  Example input: \"1R 0 2G<* 3P/~\" means a card with 1 red open oval, a card with 2 green solid diamond, and a card with 3 purple striped squiggle.
  Notice: Please follow the order of number of shapes, color, shading, and shape to specify a card!\n"""  # Input format
