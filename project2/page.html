                <p>Welcome to Set!</p>
                <p>Game Rules: </p>
                <p>The deck consists of 81 unique cards that vary in 4 features across 3 possibilities for each kind of feature: <br>
  number of shapes (1, 2, 3)
  color (red, green, or purple)
  shading (solid, striped, open)
  shape (diamond, squiggle, oval)<br>
  Each possible combination of features (e.g. a card with 3 striped green diamonds) appears as a card precisely once<br>
  in the deck. A SET must be either all the same or all different in each individual feature. In other words, if 2 cards
  are the same and 1 card is different in any feature, then it is NOT a SET (e.g. if 2 are red and 1 is purple then it<br>
  is NOT a SET). In the game, the deck is shuffled and 12 cards are laid face up on the table. When a player finds a SET
  among these 12 cards, the SET will be removed and the player gets 1 point. Then 3 new cards from the deck will be added<br>
  to replenish the cards on the table. If there is no SET on the table, 3 cards from the deck will be added one time until
  there is a SET.</p>
